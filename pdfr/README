1. Introduction

"pdfr" is a small document organizer written with python using the flask 
microframwork (http://flask.pocoo.org/). pdfr allows multiple users to enter 
a paper or journal article. Currently each article has a title, source of 
publication, a date published, link to more information about the article and 
optional comments. There is also an xml view so that the site can be monitored
with an rss reader. Currently all of the database information is stored using
sqlite3. 

This has been built using flask 0.9 and python 2.7.2.

2. Setting up

This assumes that you know how to check out a project from github and that you 
have flask installed.

Two things that need to be setup for pdfr to work, is the config file and the 
database needs to be initiliazed. 

First copy the default.conf to pdfr.conf. Edit pdfr.conf to make any appropriate
changes, such as usernames, password and the location of the database. The 
location of the database can be an absolute or relative path name.

Second initialize the DB. Go to the directory with pdfr.py and start a python
terminal. While inside of python the following commands should create a new
database.

>>> import pdfr
>>> pdfr.restartDb()

Quit python and the db that you named in pdfr.conf should be created. WARNING
this will wipe out your old DB.
